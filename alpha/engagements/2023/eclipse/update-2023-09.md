## GitHub organizations and repositories management

All repositories and organization managed by Otterdog now have secret scanning enabled. All 24 PRs that we created have been merged.

We've opened issues on projects to enable branch protection rules on their main branches. Otterdog currently manages 556 repositories accros 40 organizations. 203 (36.51%) of those repositories have their main branch protected to date.

We've started to track these data points in a dashboard:

## Sigstore

* The upgrade of our OIDC provider has been postponed to October 6th, related to problems identified during the previously scheduled upgrade. Encountered problems have been resolved and tested by stakeholders.
* Setbacks on already running (staging) setup have backtracked the status. Waiting on Fulcio issue [#1358](https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio/issues/1358) but attentive for time constraints.

## Internal infrastructure security improvment 

* We have requested and helped with the remediation of risks associated with the worst 2 offending domains to date. Among others, the identified issues were:
